# 💻 About Me

Hi, I'm Ali Aktaş, a self-taught Kotlin Android Developer. I started from scratch and have developed several applications. Through sheer determination, I've taught myself Kotlin and Android development using YouTube tutorials and Kotlin books. Just like how I taught myself mathematics, English, guitar playing, and video editing, I believe in the power of the internet and my ability to learn anything I set my mind to.
