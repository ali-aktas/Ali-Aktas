# 👋 Hi, I'm Ali Aktaş

Mobile Developer building **production-ready Android & iOS apps end-to-end** — from idea and architecture to App Store & Play Store release.

I specialize in creating real-world mobile applications with **clean architecture, scalable data models, and monetization-ready setups** across both Android and iOS platforms.
All projects below are **live in production** and built with **public, real production-level code**.

* Implement **subscriptions & monetization** (RevenueCat)
* Own the full product lifecycle: **idea → UI/UX → architecture → code → release**
